# Blob Kabooom
A game built with the limitation:
>  "3 Frame Animations"

### About the Experiance
Completed and Submitted to the Game Jam: Mini Jam 62. 
- This is the first game iv ever made
- The Jam was over a 2 day period which was a crazy deadlin, as i did not know how to use Unreal Engine
- You can find the Full game on itch.io [here](https://dylan4jacks.itch.io/blob-bombers)

### Mechanics
- This game is a 2-player game requiring only 1 keyboard.
- You take out your opponent with TNT bombs, while avoiding the explosions yourself.
- Game Jam limitation was '3 Frame animation' which made the project a real challenge.
